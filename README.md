# Credit Card Upgrade Prediction Project
The following project is a (very) simple assignment done for the module CET023 for the NTU Fleximasters in Business and Financial Analytics Programme.
The app was deployed using Streamlit Cloud and can be accessed [here](https://share.streamlit.io/ashwinphilipgeorge/credit_card_prediction/main/streamlit.py)

The app uses two features:
1. Number of purchases made by the user
2. Whether the user has a supplementary credit card
to predict whether the user will or will not upgrade their credit card. Predictions will be made by 4 models as described below.

### Models Used
1) Decision Tree (CART)
2) Random Forest Classifier
